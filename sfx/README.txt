Sound Effects for Garden Game
=============================

Please add the following sound effect files to this folder:

1. click.mp3 - A short click sound for buttons and placing plants
   Recommended: A soft, satisfying click sound

2. remove.mp3 - Sound for removing plants from the garden
   Recommended: A soft whooshing or popping sound

3. basket_full.mp3 - Alert sound when a basket becomes full of limes
   Recommended: A cheerful chime or bell sound

Note: All sound files should be in MP3 format and should be short (less than 1-2 seconds)
and not too loud. The game automatically adjusts volume, but it's best if the
source files are reasonably balanced.

The game will work without these sound files, but having them will enhance
the player experience.
